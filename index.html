                    <p class="offers__text">A book is a medium for recording information in the form of writing or images, typically composed of many pages bound together and protected by a cover. The technical term for this physical arrangement is codex.</p>

                <h3 class="cate--title">Action and Adventure</h3>
                <p class="cate--text">Action and adventure books constantly have you on the edge of your seat with excitement, as your fave main character repeatedly finds themselves in high stakes situations. The protagonist has an ultimate goal to achieve and is always put in risky, often dangerous situations. This genre typically crosses over with others like mystery, crime, sci-fi, and fantasy.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="cate__container">
                <h3 class="cate--title">Classics</h3>
                <p class="cate--text">You may think of these books as the throwback readings you were assigned in English class. (Looking at you, Charles Dickens.) The classics have been around for decades, and were often groundbreaking stories at their publish time, but have continued to be impactful for generations, serving as the foundation for many popular works we read today.</p>

            <div class="cate__container">
                <h3 class="cate--title">Comic Book or Graphic Novel</h3>
                <p class="cate--text">The stories in comic books and graphic novels are presented to the reader through engaging, sequential narrative art (illustrations and typography) that's either presented in a specific design or the traditional panel layout you find in comics. With both, you'll often find the dialogue presented in the tell-tale "word balloons" next to the respective characters.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="cate__container">
                <h3 class="cate--title">Horror</h3>
                <p class="cate--text">Meant to cause discomfort and fear for both the character and readers, horror writers often make use of supernatural and paranormal elements in morbid stories that are sometimes a little too realistic. The master of horror fiction? None other than Stephen King.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="cate__container">
                <h3 class="cate--title">Detective and Mystery</h3>
                <p class="cate--text">The plot always revolves around a crime of sorts that must be solved—or foiled—by the protagonists.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="cate__container">
                <h3 class="cate--title">Fantasy</h3>
                <p class="cate--text">While usually set in a fictional imagined world—in opposition, Ta-Nehisi's Coates's The Water Dancer takes place in the very real world of American slavery—fantasy books include prominent elements of magic, mythology, or the supernatural.</p>
